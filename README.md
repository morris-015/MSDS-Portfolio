# ðŸŽ“ MSDS Portfolio

This repository showcases selected projects from my **Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS)** program.  
Each subject has its own folder under `projects/`, containing lab exercises, final projects, and supporting materials.  

The goal of this portfolio is to highlight coursework that demonstrates skills in **data wrangling, machine learning, big data, geospatial analysis, and applied research projects**.
